We’re led by local leaders and physicians focused on addressing the diverse needs and issues of Central California. As the leading healthcare provider in the central San Joaquin Valley, Community cares for more people in the region than any other. That means regardless of income level or social demographics, we provide top notch care to support the health and well-being of those in need. We partner with UCSF — one of the world’s top three medical schools and recruit physicians from around the country and world to bring you new specialties and treatments. By creating an environment of innovation and adding advanced medical technologies to our repertoire, we assure the care you receive from the Community Medical Centers healthcare network will continue to be second-to-none.\n\nThey also have a Community Benefit Page that explicitly says under the heading “Access to Healthcare”:\n\nGoal: Increase access to healthcare services through primary care, preventative care and specialty care services, including HIV/AIDS/STIs, for medically underserved residents",
